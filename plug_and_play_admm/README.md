# Plug and Play ADMM

Implementation of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.01710.pdf) *Plug-and-Play ADMM for Image Restoration: Fixed Point Convergence and Applications*.

The denoiser is implemented in PyTorch and is inspired from the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03981) *Beyond a Gaussian Denoiser: Residual Learning of Deep CNN for Image Denoising* and this [repository](https://github.com/SaoYan/DnCNN-PyTorch).
